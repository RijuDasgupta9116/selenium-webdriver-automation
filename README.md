# Selenium Automation
Selenium automation refers to the process of automating web browsers using the Selenium framework. Selenium is a popular open-source tool that allows developers and testers to write scripts in various programming languages (such as Java, Python, or JavaScript) to automate web browser actions. These actions can include clicking buttons, filling out forms, navigating through web pages, and extracting data. Selenium automation helps streamline and accelerate the testing and validation of web applications, ensuring their functionality, compatibility, and performance.
